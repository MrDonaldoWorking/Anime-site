## Client
React Frontend

Tried hard to implement Authorization, but couldn't take next step forward in front of post request..
* `cd client`
* `npm start`

## Server
Nodejs express Backend with Session and Cookie
* `cd server`
* `npm start`

## Tests

### Unit
Header and Footer test
* `cd client`
* `npm test src/test/unit/`

### E2E
Basic logic test

Also tried hard to test with snapshots, but can't achive expected :(

* `cd client`
* `npm start`
And only after react app launched, type:
* `npm test src/test/e2e`
